# Qwister
iOS Application for Twister Spinner
### What does it do?
Have ever been at a party and wanted to play a quick game of Twister, but you couldn't find a spinner? Or if you did find a spinner
it was old and warped and kept getting stuck on left foot red?  
Well now there's no need to fear, with __Qwister__! Simply download the app from the app store, and it's all yours!
### Features
Along from always being reliable and at your fingertips, __Qwister__ has some innovative features that even a perfect Twister Spinner doesn't have. These include:
* Smart Spinners.
  * Spinners won't say left-foot-red if your foot is already on left-foot-red! This allows for faster game play and less confusion amoung players.
* Text-to-speech techonology using iOS 7 features allows for the app to call out commands hands-free, meaning you can finally play Twister by yourself!
* Simple user-interface tells you where each limb should be on the board at any given time.
* Three different gameplay modes to allow for very custom experiences.
  1. Manual
    * Allows users to manually spin the spinner by simply tapping the screen, for a more traditional approach
  2. Automatic
    * Allows users to have the computer call out a command every x seconds. Great for small parties where everyone wants to play.
  3. Semi-Autonomous
    * The perfect marriage of the first two modes. Users can tap the screen to spin the spinner, but when the given elapsed time has passed, the computer will automatically update... NOT DONE
